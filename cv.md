Brief information about me:
the purpose of my training is to radically change the field of activity. I want to try and learn something new. There is no experience in this area. There is a desire, which means everything will work out. 
```
int multiply(int a, int b)
{
    a*b;
}
```
## knowledge of English - I understand a little, but I canâ€™t say anything
